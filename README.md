A WIP game created for the UC Merced Aqua Game Jam https://itch.io/jam/aquaarcade

H2Outpost

The Olmechas are a space-faring civilization consisting entirely of automatons. They’re currently exploring new solar systems to find some place to find home. To help expedite the process, instead of bringing their entire mothership to each potential planet, the Olmechas created the Pioneer Initiative, in which a small group of robot scouts are sent to live on the nominated locations for a trial period. The scout squadron is tasked with collecting metal from the planet for the creation of a beacon. If the pioneers manage to complete this goal, the Olmechas’ primary ship will arrive at the planet and settle there because the completion of the beacon proves that the land is sustainable.  

You play as Poseid-1, the leader of team AQUA from the Pioneer Initiative. You are tasked with managing the settlement on the planet designated Gaia, which is the most promising prospect for a new home in a long time. Your job is to make the final decisions on the most important choices for the colony, ranging from policy changes for improved production to responses to unprecedented events. While this planet is bountiful, team AQUA will soon discover that it is also incredibly fragile– so its fate is entirely in your hands.

Currently, the game is merely a Proof of Concept. We weren't able to have our full vision realized during the alloted time period, but the jam was fun nonetheless. :]
