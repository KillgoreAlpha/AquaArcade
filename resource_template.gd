# This is an instantiated scene that would hold all the parts of an element's nodes
# Including the sprite, the detector for when the mouse hovers over the object, and the tooltip
# We could have each individual node manage their resource quantities,
# But it'd probably be more convenient to store them all in the main script
# and use this node's scripts to pull up information about the resource

# BTW Currently the Tooltip only appears after you hover over its area for a moment, will need to fix that
